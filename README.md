# Nat-weather-dashboard

## Description

The challenge was to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. When you search for a city, you are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. When you view current weather conditions for that city, you are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed. When I view future weather conditions for that city, you are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity. When you click on a city in the search history, the you are again presented with the current and future conditions for that city.
